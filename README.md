# About
This is a robust Bash script designed to monitor CPU temperature and log any unexpected spikes. With this script, you will be notified when the CPU temperature exceeds a defined threshold, eliminating the need for regular manual checks.

--------------------------

# Features
- **Automated Monitoring:** Continuously monitors CPU temperature.
- **Logging:** Logs significant events using `logger(1)` and integrates seamlessly with `journalctl(1)` for detailed runtime analysis.
- **User Alerts:** Provides real-time notifications for high CPU temperatures.
- **Instance Management:** Uses a PID file to prevent multiple instances of the script from running concurrently.
- **Automated Testing:** Validated behavior using the Bash Automated Testing System (BATS).

--------------------------

# How to Use

1. **Install lm-sensors**
   The script uses the `lm-sensors` program to retrieve CPU temperature data. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install lm-sensors  # For Debian-based systems
   ```
   For more information, visit the [lm-sensors GitHub repository](https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors).

2. **Configure the Script**
   - Modify line 45 of `cpu_temp_alarm.sh` to correctly parse and obtain the float value of your CPU temperature.
   - Adjust the threshold values or notification settings in the script as needed.

3. **Run the Script**
   Start the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   $ /path/to/cpu_temp_alarm.sh
   ```

4. **Stop the Script**
   To stop the script, run the `kill_cpu_temp_alarm.sh` file, which terminates the script using its PID:
   ```bash
   $ /path/to/kill_cpu_temp_alarm.sh
   ```

5. **View Logs**
   To review logs generated by the script, use the following command:
   ```bash
   $ journalctl -t cpu_temp_alarm
   ```

--------------------------

# Important Notes

- **Configuration Consistency:** If you modify any variables in `cpu_temp_alarm.sh` (e.g., the PID file path), ensure the same changes are reflected in `kill_cpu_temp_alarm.sh`.
- **Testing:** The script's behavior has been validated using BATS. You can review the tests in the repository and adapt them as needed for your environment.
- **Customizability:** The script is designed to be easily customizable. Modify it to suit your specific needs, such as changing the alerting mechanism or logging level.
